# Trust policies

This helm chart installs GitHub's `TrustRoot` and a default `ClusterImagePolicy` meant to be used with the <https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller>, and which can be used to enforce that images installed in your Kubernetes cluster originated within a given repository, organization, or were generated by a given reusable workflow.

See the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file for more information on which fields can be customized.
