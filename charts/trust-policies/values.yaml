policy:
  # To verify an attestation, we must validate the identity of the workflow that signed it, which is stored in the attestation's certificate's subject alternative name.
  # To validate the signer workflow's identity, you can set the subjectRegExp value, or set the organization and the repository values below.
  #
  # policy.organization is used to validate the signer workflow's identity. An attestation is valid if it was generated inside a repository owned by this organization.
  # Required if policy.enabled is true and policy.subjectRegExp has not been set.
  organization:
  # policy.repository is used to validate the signer workflow's identity. An attestation is valid if it was generated inside this specific repository.
  # Must be used in combination with the policy.organization value.
  repository: '.*'
  # policy.subjectRegExp is a regex used to validate the signer workflow's identity. Use this if your attestations are generated with a reusable workflow.
  # Required if policy.enabled is true and policy.organization has not been set.
